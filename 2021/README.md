## Welcome
These are my notes on solving Advent of Code 2021. The challenges were not completed competitively for time.

## Notes on Each Day

### Day 1
- Part1:
	- Simple loop that compares to previous
- Part2:
	- Expansion of part1, need to calculate simple moving averages first.

### Day 2
- No significant notes, straightforward [x,y,direction] tracking.

### Day 3
- Converted input into a 2-D list, and then processed by columns
- Part2 was a bit trickier. It's a type of search, I believe with complexity `nm` in the worst case since you need to go down each column.

### Day 4
- Day 4 lends itself to defining a few objects to represent the bingo board and subsequent checks we may want to do on a bingo board.

### Day 5
- Simple 2-D coordinate math
